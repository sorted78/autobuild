# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure automatic deployment to S3 using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ What Gets Automated

Every time you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:
1. ‚úÖ Check out your code
2. ‚úÖ Run `build.py` to generate the HTML
3. ‚úÖ Deploy to S3 automatically
4. ‚úÖ Update your live website

**No manual deployment needed!**

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your AWS Credentials

You need to create AWS credentials that GitHub can use. You have two options:

#### Option A: Use Your Existing Credentials (Quick)

If you're already using AWS CLI, your credentials are in `~/.aws/credentials`:

```bash
cat ~/.aws/credentials
```

Look for:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

#### Option B: Create New IAM User (Recommended for Production)

1. Go to [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Click "Users" ‚Üí "Create user"
3. Username: `github-actions-autobuild`
4. Click "Next"
5. Select "Attach policies directly"
6. Search and attach: `AmazonS3FullAccess` (or create a custom policy for just your bucket)
7. Click "Next" ‚Üí "Create user"
8. Click on the new user
9. Go to "Security credentials" tab
10. Click "Create access key"
11. Choose "Application running outside AWS"
12. Click "Next" ‚Üí "Create access key"
13. **SAVE THESE CREDENTIALS** (you'll only see them once!)

---

### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/sorted78/autobuild

2. Click **Settings** (top menu)

3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**

4. Click **New repository secret**

5. Add the first secret:
   - **Name:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - **Value:** Your AWS access key ID (starts with `AKIA...`)
   - Click **Add secret**

6. Click **New repository secret** again

7. Add the second secret:
   - **Name:** `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your AWS secret access key
   - Click **Add secret**

---

### Step 3: Test the Workflow

#### Option A: Make a Small Change

Let's test it by updating the website:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/sorted78/autobuild.git
cd autobuild

# Edit build.py - change the title or colors
nano build.py  # or use your favorite editor

# Commit and push
git add build.py
git commit -m "Test CI/CD: Update website styling"
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Trigger

1. Go to https://github.com/sorted78/autobuild/actions
2. Click on "Deploy to S3" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Click the green "Run workflow" button

---

### Step 4: Watch It Deploy!

1. Go to https://github.com/sorted78/autobuild/actions

2. You'll see your workflow running with a yellow dot üü°

3. Click on it to see the live logs

4. When it turns green ‚úÖ, your site is deployed!

5. Visit http://autobuild-time-display-static.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com to see your changes

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Custom IAM Policy (Most Secure)

Instead of `AmazonS3FullAccess`, create a custom policy that only allows access to your bucket:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::autobuild-time-display-static",
        "arn:aws:s3:::autobuild-time-display-static/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To apply this:
1. IAM Console ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Create policy
2. Click JSON tab
3. Paste the above policy
4. Name it: `GitHubActionsAutobuildPolicy`
5. Create policy
6. Attach it to your IAM user

## üìä Monitoring Deployments

### View Deployment History
```bash
# List all workflow runs
gh run list --repo sorted78/autobuild

# View details of the last run
gh run view --repo sorted78/autobuild
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# View logs of the last run
gh run view --log --repo sorted78/autobuild
```

Or visit: https://github.com/sorted78/autobuild/actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails with "403 Forbidden"
- **Cause:** AWS credentials are incorrect or don't have S3 permissions
- **Fix:** Check your GitHub secrets and IAM permissions

### Workflow Fails with "Bucket not found"
- **Cause:** Bucket name mismatch
- **Fix:** Ensure the bucket name in the workflow matches your actual bucket

### Secrets Not Working
- **Cause:** Typo in secret names
- **Fix:** Secret names must be EXACTLY:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Re-add Secrets
If you need to update credentials:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click on the secret name
3. Click "Update secret"
4. Enter new value

## üéØ Workflow Features

### Automatic Triggers
- ‚úÖ Runs on every push to `main`
- ‚úÖ Can be manually triggered from GitHub UI

### What It Does
1. Checks out your code
2. Sets up Python
3. Runs `build.py` to generate HTML
4. Configures AWS credentials
5. Uploads to S3 with proper headers
6. Shows deployment summary

### Deployment Time
- **Typical duration:** 30-60 seconds
- **Cost:** FREE (GitHub Actions has generous free tier)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Add More Environments

Create separate workflows for staging and production:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
# Deploy to: autobuild-staging bucket
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
# Deploy to: autobuild-time-display-static bucket
```

### Add Tests

Add a testing job before deployment:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: python3 -m py_compile build.py
      
  deploy:
    needs: test  # Only deploy if tests pass
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ... deployment steps
```

### Notifications

Get notified when deployments complete:

```yaml
- name: Notify on success
  if: success()
  run: |
    # Send Slack notification, email, etc.
```
